Schwarz Waveform Relaxation (SWR) methods arise naturally when considering
heterogeneous domain decomposition problems.
SWR methods often need
a proper optimization of their convergence rate to be efficient.
When considering a discrete setting rather than the continuous differential equations, a more accurate estimation of the numerical convergence rate can be obtained.
Through the study of two coupled reaction-diffusion equations with different diffusivities, this talk explores
particularities of discrete and semi-discrete analyses, and compares them to the continuous setting.
In particular, choices for interface discretizations are discussed and a complementary analysis based on so-called "equivalent PDE" is presented.
