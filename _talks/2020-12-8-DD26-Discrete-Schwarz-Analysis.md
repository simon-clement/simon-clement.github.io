Schwarz alternating methods arise naturally when considering
multi-physics domain decomposition problems.
The convergence rate of Schwarz algorithm
can be optimized with regards to free parameters,
in order to compensate its relative slowness.
This optimization requires an accurate estimation
of the convergence rate: discrete or semi-discrete analyses give convergence rates
closer to those numerically observed.
By considering two coupled reaction-diffusion equation with different diffusivities, this talk explores the
features of discrete and semi-discrete analyses, and compares them to the continuous setting.
