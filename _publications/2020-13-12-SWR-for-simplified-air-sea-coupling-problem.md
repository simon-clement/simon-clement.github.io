In this study we present a non-overlapping Schwarz waveform relaxation (SWR) method applied to a one dimensional model problem representative of the coupling between the ocean and the atmosphere. This problem includes nonlinear interface conditions analogous to a quadratic friction law. We study the convergence of the corresponding SWR at a semi-discrete level for a linear friction and for a linearized quadratic friction at the interface. Using numerical experiments we show that the convergence properties in the linearized quadratic friction case are very close to the ones obtained with the full nonlinear problem for the range of parameter values of interest. We investigate the possibility to improve the convergence speed by adding a relaxation parameter at the interface.
