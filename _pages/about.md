I am a PhD student in the Laboratoire Jean Kuntzmann (LJK, Grenoble, France).
I am part of the AIRSEA team, which is oriented towards the understanding (mathematically and numerically) of the ocean atmosphere system.

The goal of my PhD (supervised by Eric Blayo and Florian Lemari√©) is to use and analyse [Schwarz coupling methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarz_alternating_method) while taking
into account the physical constraints specific to the interface between the ocean and atmosphere.

I also teach at the DLST (MAT104, Mathematics tools for physics (see [Teaching](teaching/))).

My contact adress is [First Name].[Last Name]@grenoble-inp.org.
